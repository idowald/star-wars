# Why this tech stack?
- Sagas: easy to work with parallel actions and apis. good testing techniques also. And of course separation of concern- logic in one place only. easy to go to react-server-side and test components in isolation
- Redux: one state to rule them all, gives nice split to the applications layers / logic so it is easier to maintain and test.
- React: Because it is fast(!) have many libraries that supports it and also really minimal logic in jsx.
- React-create-scripts: Because that is the official and correct way to start react application, the libraries versions are all set in to go. But- need to remove unneeded dependencies and components.

# How to run

1. run install `yarn` or `npm i`
2. run the dev script (although also build is fine) `npm start`
3. Go to http://localhost:1234
